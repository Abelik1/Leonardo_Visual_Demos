# Demo implementation guidance

This file applies to every solver in this directory. Read the matching
`docs/demos/<demo-id>/README.md` and `AGENTS.md` before changing a demo.

## Shared contract

- Keep `frames/frame_NNNN.jpg` free of titles, readouts, legends, and control
  panels. Presentation belongs in `web/app.js` as HTML.
- Publish changing values through `RunContext.write_status(..., overlay={...})`.
- Put alternate scientific views in `modes/<mode>/`; put optional diagnostic
  imagery such as neural graphs in `overlays/<name>/`.
- Keep total numerical work controlled by the active profile, not multiplied
  accidentally by the requested frame count.
- Make CPU, GPU, and hybrid results scientifically equivalent. Never label a
  fallback as GPU or training when it is not.
- Treat reveals as real independent simulations or parameter sweeps. Honour
  `_parallel_count` when the demo supports a reveal ensemble.
- Update `config/demo_specs.json`, every relevant profile, viewer explanations,
  scientific notes, and tests when adding a parameter or output mode.
- State model limitations honestly. These are exhibition models, not automatic
  substitutes for validated research solvers.

## Per-file cautions

- `black_hole.py`: preserve separate 2-D observer and numerical 3-D ray modes;
  do not describe the weak-field spin term as a Kerr integrator.
- `pbh.py`: preserve the collapse/dispersion threshold story and reduced-model
  disclaimer; do not claim full numerical relativity.
- `fluid.py`: the rendered obstacle must be the exact bounce-back mask; custom
  grids must remain bounded and keep inlet/outlet edges open.
- `cosmic_web.py`: expansion, dark-energy acceleration, and warm-DM cutoff are
  independently selectable; label the latter two as qualitative comparisons.
- `galaxy_collision.py`: retain Milky Way/M31 physical units and the genuine
  transverse-velocity reveal sweep.
- `galaxy_collision_3d.py`: every displayed super-particle participates in the
  softened direct force; keep interactive JSON synchronized with JPEG frames.
- `reaction_diffusion.py`: preserve Gray-Scott stability and mature the reveal
  sweep enough for neighbouring feed/kill values to differ visibly.
- `crystal.py`: deep zoom must regenerate geometry, not enlarge a bitmap; keep
  recursive work bounded and process-parallel where appropriate.
- `neural_wall.py`: the main image is the RGB coordinate-network output; target,
  weights, loss, and network graph stay outside the main frame.
- `fusion_plasma.py`: write one rotatable 3-D state per frame; magnetic geometry
  is explanatory and must not be called a solved equilibrium.
- `plasma_guardian.py`: main frames contain vessel state only; sensor panels and
  policy topology are overlays. Amber is tearing-risk proxy; red is baseline.
- `weather_ensemble.py`: the reveal must remain an initial-condition ensemble,
  with uncertainty affecting members rather than only their labels.
- `molecular_dynamics.py`: preserve stable integration, bounded all-pairs work,
  and the coarse-grained—not atomistic—description.

## Verification

Run `node --check web/app.js`, then `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m unittest
discover -s tests` on Windows. Render at least one short run for any changed
solver and inspect both the main frame and every alternative view it writes.
