# Scientific notes and limitations

The demos aim to make legitimate computational ideas visible, but they intentionally trade production-level physical detail for fast iteration and a coherent exhibition experience.

## Black-hole lensing

The demo has two separate scientific views. **2-D observer image** is an exhibition-grade image-space gravitational lens mapping: every output pixel is mapped back to the source sky in parallel, producing lens-like warping and a stylised emission ring. **3-D ray space** numerically advances photon directions through a three-dimensional point-mass deflection field, renormalising the direction after each step and adding a small signed spin-like transverse term. The displayed paths therefore come from the integrator rather than decorative Bezier curves, and rays can either escape to the source plane or cross the capture radius.

This is still a weak-field educational model, not a full Schwarzschild/Kerr null-geodesic integrator and not GRMHD. The spin term is qualitative rather than a validated frame-dragging solution. For a research-accurate flagship, replace `integrate_rays()` and `lens()` with a validated relativistic ray tracer while keeping the two-mode frame/output interface.

## PBH

The supplied capstone describes a Misner-Sharp / Chebyshev pseudo-spectral / RK4 solver and a critical threshold near `δc ≈ 0.49774` for its chosen setup. The repository does **not** silently claim to reproduce that full numerical-relativity solver. `PBHDemo` is a reduced qualitative exhibition model whose only purpose is to make the collapse-versus-dispersion narrative and parameter sweep testable.

Use `tools/render_pbh_research.py` to convert output from the validated research code into the exhibition frame format. This is the recommended route for the final EuroHPC display.

## Fluid

The fluid module is a real D2Q9 lattice-Boltzmann solver in two dimensions. It
is suitable for qualitative wakes and vortex shedding, not quantitative
aerodynamics around a real aircraft or car. The circular obstacle is
intentionally simple.

The displayed background is flow **speed**, with vorticity as a secondary tint;
an earlier version showed |vorticity| on a fire palette, which read as a heat
map rather than as moving air. Overlaid streaklines are passive tracers
advected by the same velocity field, drawn with a short position history so a
still frame carries flow direction. Their time step is amplified for legibility
— they are a visualisation of the velocity field, not a second physical
integration. Reported pressure is p = (rho - 1)/3 from the lattice density.

## Cosmic web

The cosmic-web code is a real 2-D particle-mesh gravitational model: Zel'dovich
initial conditions drawn from a power-law power spectrum, an FFT Poisson solve
on the density contrast, nearest-grid-point deposition/sampling, and comoving
integration on a matter-dominated expanding background.

It is still **not a cosmological precision code**: two dimensions only, a
power-law P(k) rather than a real transfer function, no cosmological parameter
integration, nearest-grid-point rather than CIC assignment, and no force
resolution study.

### Gas composition

The `helium` parameter is the helium mass fraction. Masses are the physical
ones: hydrogen A = 1.008, helium-4 A = 4.003. Note that helium's atomic
*number* is 2 but its *mass* number is 4, and it is the mass that sets the gas
dynamics. The mean molecular weight of a neutral H/He mix is

    mu = 1 / (X/1.008 + Y/4.003),   X + Y = 1

giving mu = 1.008 for pure hydrogen, 1.229 for the primordial mix (Y = 0.24)
and 4.003 for pure helium. Since the sound speed goes as sqrt(T/mu), a heavier
mean molecular weight means a shorter Jeans length and therefore finer
structure. This is applied as a Jeans-scale smoothing of the potential. It is a
legitimate scaling, not a full two-fluid treatment: there is no thermal
evolution, no cooling, and no ionisation history.

## Galaxy collision

This is a restricted N-body encounter: tracer stars feel two softened (Plummer)
galaxy potentials while the galaxy centres mutually accelerate. Tracers do not
contribute self-gravity, and there is no dynamical friction, so the orbit does
not decay the way a real merger's does.

Positions and velocities are advanced with the same kick-drift-kick leapfrog
scheme on NumPy and CuPy. CPU workers operate only on disjoint tracer slices;
that execution detail does not change the force model or initial conditions.

The default preset uses published Local Group values: M_MW and M_M31 of about
1.5x10^12 solar masses each, a separation of 770 kpc, a radial approach
velocity of -109 km/s and a transverse velocity of about 17 km/s (van der Marel
et al. 2012, ApJ 753, 8; refined by Gaia astrometry). Working units are kpc,
km/s and solar masses, so the on-screen clock in Gyr is meaningful.

Treat the outcome as *a* plausible encounter, not a prediction. The masses are
virial estimates with large error bars and the transverse velocity in
particular is uncertain at the tens-of-km/s level — which is exactly what the
reveal sweep illustrates. Without dynamical friction this model shows the first
passage and tidal bridge faithfully but will not settle into a merger remnant.

The opening discs use observationally motivated morphology (a four-arm Milky
Way disc; a two-arm, ringed M31 disc), and the renderer accumulates each
tracer's represented mass into pixels before assigning brightness and colour.
This makes overlap visibly brighter, but the particle positions are still
generated tracers, **not** an imported Gaia/PHAT star catalogue. The PHAT/PHAST
catalogues resolve tens of millions of M31 stars and are too large to download
inside an exhibition run. The optional `data/m31_catalog_reduced.npz` asset is
the defined catalogue-driven route: `tools/reduce_star_catalog.py` combines a
curator-supplied, deprojected CSV into spatial cells, storing each cell's
weighted centre of mass and total flux/mass. If that asset is present, M31
positions are weighted resamples of it; otherwise the morphology model is
used. This changes the initial tracer distribution, not the restricted-N-body
physics or its limitations.

## Reaction diffusion

This is a genuine Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion finite-difference simulation
with periodic boundaries, integrated on a 16:9 domain so the displayed spots
are not stretched. The step budget is set per profile rather than derived from
the frame count: the pattern needs O(10^4) steps to fill the domain, and a
frame-derived budget stopped near 10^3, leaving the screen almost empty.

## Crystal growth

The crystal module is **not** a phase-field PDE solver. It is a recursive
geometric growth model: a set of line segments generated by applying the same
branching rule at successively smaller scales, with six named habits (classic,
fern, seaweed, star, coral, plate) and a selectable symmetry.

This is an honest description of what it does — it is procedural geometry that
imitates dendritic morphology, not a solved free-boundary problem. Real habit
selection depends on temperature and supersaturation (the Nakaya diagram); here
the habit is simply chosen. Do not present it as a calibrated ice-growth
calculation.

The advantage of the geometric form is that it is resolution independent. The
viewer regenerates the geometry for whatever window is on screen, so magnifying
reveals genuinely finer branch generations rather than enlarged pixels, without
a fixed depth limit.

Be clear about what that means physically: the branching rule is applied at
every scale because it is *defined* at every scale, not because a real crystal
is self-similar without end. Real dendrites stop at the scale set by molecular
attachment kinetics and the diffusion field. The unbounded zoom is a property
of the model, not a claim about ice.

## Neural-network wall

Each model is a small coordinate MLP: it is given a pixel coordinate `(x,y)`
and learns to output three values `(R,G,B)`. That is why it can recreate a
drawn, uploaded or visitor-captured image without recognising what the image
contains. It is fitting a coloured function over a small canvas, not classifying
a face or a digit. Camera consent and capture occur in the browser; only the
captured 128-pixel RGB target is included in the run request.

When PyTorch is installed the module performs genuine training of many small
coordinate MLPs. The networks are held as stacked (N, in, out) weight tensors
and advanced with one batched forward/backward and a hand-written Adam step
carrying a per-network learning rate, so the whole ensemble is a single set of
matmuls — the structure that actually maps onto a GPU. Hidden width is varied
by masking unused units. Networks are laid out as a 2-D hyperparameter grid:
learning rate along a row, width down a column.

Without PyTorch it falls back to a deterministic Fourier reconstruction
surrogate. The surrogate is **not training**: the frame headline, subtitle and
badge all say so explicitly, and the metadata reports `numpy-surrogate`. Do not
call the fallback "neural-network training" during a public presentation.

## Star in a Bottle / fusion plasma

This demo integrates the complex Ginzburg--Landau amplitude equation on a
periodic 2-D lattice and maps that field onto a torus. The equation is a real
nonlinear wave model that produces coherent waves, defects and spatiotemporal
turbulence; it is useful for exposing the compute pattern of a plasma field
solver. Magnetic field, heating and density alter its dimensionless drive,
dispersion and damping coefficients.

It is **not** a predictive tokamak code, gyrokinetic simulation, MHD equilibrium
solver or model of any particular reactor. The displayed tesla and megawatt
controls provide an intuitive operating-space narrative, but the coefficient
mapping is illustrative and must not be used to infer fusion performance. The
reveal is nevertheless genuine computation: every tile integrates a separate
field with different control values.

The luminous moving particles are **passive tracers**, not kinetic plasma
particles and not additional degrees of freedom in the field solve. Their
toroidal and poloidal drift is sampled from local phase gradients and rotated
amplitude gradients of the evolved field. They make transport and changing
flow direction visible without feeding back into the simulation. The short
trails are trajectory history; camera rotation is deliberately slower so the
field-driven motion remains distinguishable from the changing viewpoint.

Completed fusion runs also write `fusion_view.json`, a compact copy of the
final field texture and tracer histories used by the browser's rotatable view.
The optional magnetic view draws nested helical curves and the magnetic axis
to explain toroidal confinement. Those curves respond to the selected field
strength through an illustrative pitch mapping, but they are **not** magnetic
field lines calculated by the complex-amplitude solver and must not be
presented as a solved Grad--Shafranov equilibrium or safety-factor profile.

## AI Plasma Guardian

This is a **research-inspired reduced control environment**, not a tokamak
equilibrium, transport, or tearing-mode solver. Its six state variables are
radial and vertical position/velocity plus dimensionless pressure and
tearing-risk proxies. Three aggregate actuator outputs represent radial,
vertical and shaping coil banks. Open-loop positive feedback makes the
reference trajectory approach the vessel boundary; a small PyTorch MLP is
optimized by back-propagating through batches of those virtual trajectories to
minimize displacement, risk, velocity, and coil effort.

The demo genuinely trains a neural feedback policy and uses its learned weights
to draw the policy graph and its actions to drive the coloured coils. It must
not be presented as a controller validated on experimental tokamak data, an RL
controller, or a prediction of a physical disruption. It is a visual
explanation of the diagnostic → policy → magnetic-actuator loop demonstrated
in modern plasma-control research.

## Storm Factory / weather ensemble

The atmosphere is a reduced barotropic-vorticity model coupled to an advected
moisture scalar on a latitude/longitude grid. A spectral Poisson inversion
recovers a streamfunction from vorticity; finite differences then advect
potential vorticity and moisture. This is a legitimate reduced geophysical
fluid model and the reveal members really do start from different smoothed
initial perturbations.

It is not an operational weather forecast. It has one vertical layer, stylised
forcing and damping, no assimilated observations, no topography and no full
thermodynamics. The continents are deliberately low-resolution procedural
geography used only for orientation. Forecast hours and warming controls are
part of the exhibition story, not calibrated predictions of a named storm.

## Molecular Machine / molecular dynamics

This is coarse-grained 3-D molecular dynamics. Consecutive particles have
harmonic bonds; non-neighbours interact through a softened, type-dependent
Lennard-Jones force; a deterministic thermostat controls kinetic temperature.
All non-bonded pairs are evaluated, so the displayed pair-evaluation count and
the quadratic scaling story are real. Every reveal tile is an independently
integrated trajectory with its own initial velocities and sequence pattern.

The particles are beads, not individual atoms. There is no explicit water,
electrostatics, chemical bonding, force-field parameterisation or physical
time calibration, and the model must not be presented as a drug-binding or
protein-structure prediction. Its role is to visualise molecular ensembles and
the computational structure of pair forces.
